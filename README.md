# Product Sales and Popularity Analysis [Amazon]
My goal is to understand the correlation between product ratings on Amazon and its discounted prices. This analysis identifies trends between amazon __product ratings__, __product rating count__ and __discounted product prices__.

## Dashboard: [Amazon Sales](https://public.tableau.com/views/h_17452613845220/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## My goal is to understand what influence a discount has on product ratings on Amazon.
### Hypothesis:
1. If a product has a lower rating then the discount will be higher
2. If a product has a higher discount then the rating will be higher
3. If a product has a discount then it will also have more reviews
